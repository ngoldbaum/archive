## Follow-up from the last meeting / discussions

_For the notes from the previous meeting, visit: https://github.com/numpy/archive/tree/main/community_meetings

- (after rc1 and maybe rc2) How to announce 2.0?
  - Blog post on scientific python (probably)
  - Slightly longer news article on numpy.org
  - Not in a hurry, final release is in a few weeks.
  - Can also add a short snippet into the project readme "on github".

- Nathan did a global state refactor in response to Sebastian's suggestion, needs to be reviewed.

- Had a big discussion about semantics of re-enabling the GIL, motivated by https://github.com/numpy/numpy/issues/26622.
    * Currently you need to manually disable the GIL to run numpy without the GIL.
    * Need a prerelease pip to install the correct wheel.

- [name=rgommers] Roadmap update: https://github.com/numpy/numpy/pull/26505
    * Still moving forward, a few more people want to look.

- NEP 50 and NumPy API 2.0 changes: we should apply the  label to be able to keep track.


## New topics

- Sebastian gave an update about the scientific-python meeting.

- [name=mtsokol] Array API compatibility for `np.ceil`, `np.floor`, and `np.trunc`:
  ```
    In [136]: np.ceil(np.ones(4, dtype=np.int32)).dtype
    Out[136]: dtype('float64')

    In [137]: np.floor(np.ones(4, dtype=np.float32)).dtype
    Out[137]: dtype('float32')

    In [138]: np.trunc(np.ones(4, dtype=np.uint8)).dtype
    Out[138]: dtype('float16')
  ```
